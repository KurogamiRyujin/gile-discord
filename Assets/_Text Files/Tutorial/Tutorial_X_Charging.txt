The Sky Fragment in this hammer feels like it can charge up its essensce.
If we can hit it with enough essence, we might be able to stabilize that thing.
Though, we probably have to make sure the essence is just right.
We have to make one of the values adjust towards the one I placed a mark above the bar.
Think of it like a test of strength.
